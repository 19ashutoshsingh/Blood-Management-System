- Find an issue that you think you can solve.
If you do not find any issue, try to create one by identifying problems in the project, or wanting to improve something, anything you wish.
- Always ask for the issue to be assigned and only then start working on it.
- Fork the repo. Clone it. Make changes in the code and push to your fork. Then create a pull request. 

- If you have problem with the above workflow, take help from mentors or search about the same on youtube and you will be able to do it.
